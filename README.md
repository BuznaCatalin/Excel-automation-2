## An automated script that picks a column by your choice and sorts the data from inside in n different files (depends on how many inputs are in the specific column).
## Example:
- If we have office.xlsx that contain 5 columns (Name, Phone, Address, Number, Difficulty)
- Difficulty column contains 3 different inputs (Easy, Medium, Hard)
- We want to split that column into 3 different excel files, one for every input
- After splitting we will have 3 files created (Easy.xlsx, Medium.xlsx, Hard.xlsx)  that will contain all the data related to them.
